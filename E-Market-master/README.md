# *E-Market App*
This project is an E-commerce website for buying and selling Item Developed in .NET Core 6 using C# and the MVC architecture.
=============
This project consists of an E-Market App which allows us to publish advertisements for objects that we need to put up for sale. It has user authentication so that users can register and have access to the main page of the app where there They will be able to publish ads to sell and also view the ads that have been published by other users.

It is important to note that the active user's ads will not be displayed on the home page, only other users' ads will be visible. In addition, the main page of the app has a search filter by name if you are looking for a specific item and a filter by category if you want to see only ads from a particular category.

It is worth mentioning that the application has a section for "My ads" in which the user who is active can view the ads that have been published so far and in the same way can carry out CRUD operations, that is, create a new sales ad, Edit one of your existing ads or delete it if necessary.

The application also has a category section, which allows you to select which category will be the advertisement you want to publish, highlighting that we can also perform CRUD operations in it.

This application was made by implementing the Code First approach with EntityFramework in ASP.Net Core with MVC and the Onion architecture with repositories and generic services.
